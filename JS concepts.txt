The Spread Operator
    The JavaScript spread operator (...) expands an iterable (like an array) into more elements.

    This allows us to quickly copy all or parts of an existing array into another array:

        const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
        const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
        const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];

        The "spread" operator spreads elements of iterable objects:

        1,2,3,4,5,6
